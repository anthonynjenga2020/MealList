# MealList
a Vue/VueX application that uses free third party API with build recipe and meal search.
While building this App I learnt how to interact with APIs,
how to define parent and child roots in Vue.js,
how to define layouts,
how to build scalable files and folder structure,
how to use Vue Composition API among other things,
I used Tailwind CSS for the styling.
